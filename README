I have setup a paver script to create a virtualenv and install all needed
dependencies. You do not need paver or virtualenv to use this script as it
will set those up for you. If you want to change the paver script though, you
are going to need to have paver installed.

The following steps will get your virtualenv setup and started:

python bootstrap.py
. bin/activate

The first line will install all dependencies and make the virualenv if it
doesn't exist. The second line activates the virtualenv so that packages
installed while in virtualenv are accessible. You can leave virtualenv with
a simple 'deactivate'
