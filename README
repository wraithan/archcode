Our development environment now depends on virtualenv and paver. Both of
which can easily be installed via easy_install or via AUR from aur/virtualenv
and aur/python-paver. This is to simplify the build process as we gain more 
dependencies. django-registration is our first/only dependency right now but
likely I will be adding django-profile and down the line we will see what
else is needed.

The following steps will get your virtualenv setup and started:

python bootstrap.py
. bin/activate

The first line will install all dependencies and make the virualenv if it
doesn't exist. The second line activates the virtualenv so that packages
installed while in virtualenv are accessible. You can leave virtualenv with
a simple 'deactivate'
